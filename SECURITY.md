# Security Policy

We take the safety of automation workloads seriously. If you discover a
vulnerability in `octodns-metaname`, please email
[john@opsdev.nz](mailto:john@opsdev.nz). When possible, encrypt the report
using the GPG key published on [pgp.net.nz](https://pgp.net.nz/) for that
address. Public issues or pull requests should be avoided until we have a fix
ready.

When reporting:

1. Include a proof-of-concept or reproduction steps.
2. Share the impact (e.g., credential disclosure, privilege escalation).
3. Provide the versions/commit hashes you tested.

We aim to acknowledge new reports within 2 business days and will keep you
updated as we investigate.
